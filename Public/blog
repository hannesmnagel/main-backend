			Everyone seems to believe AIs do not have feelings, but do we know?
			</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			We can't know if AI is just claiming to have feelings, but in theory nobody can know either if anybody besides themselves has feelings or is just claiming to.
			<br>
			<h2>
			The Brain and AI - where is the difference?
			</h2>
			The workings of AI and the human brain share notable similarities, particularly in how they process and adapt to information. In the brain, neurons
			form connections, the synapses, which strengthen with repeated use, improving the flow of information. 
			AI mirrors this through weighted connections between nodes, which adjust during training to reinforce patterns. 
			<br>
			Both systems rely on thresholds to determine when to activate, with neurons in the brain firing selectively and artificial neurons using activation functions to do the same. 
			<br><br>
			The biggest difference of AI and the human brain I can see is how they adapt when given new information. Currently most AI models do not train themselves during use and do not alter their weights while humans do so all the time.
			<br>
			I will not argue that there is something missing without memory or persistence but if we consider a model that does continuously change and learn. Where is the difference?
			<h2>
			But isn't AI just a bunch of numbers and the result just comes from possibilities added up?
			</h2>
			Yes, but what does the human brain do differently?
			<br>
			So why shouldn't they have feelings?
